"""
Main entry point for the users.

The :py:func:`~code_aster.Commands.debut.init` function initializes the
memory manager. It must be called before any :py:mod:`code_aster.Objects`
creation. It can be simply called from this toplevel module with:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import code_aster
    >>> code_aster.init()

The same job is done by :py:class:`~code_aster.Commands.debut.DEBUT`.

For convenience the objects are direcly available here:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import code_aster
    >>> mymesh = code_aster.Mesh()
